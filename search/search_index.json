Some of the characteristics which you will learn and see in action include: Compute processing is performed in memory and in parallel. Data is pipelined between query stages and over the network reducing latency overhead that one would have if disk I/O were involved. Executing and analyzing analytic workloads Let us start with some simple examples of running queries and analyze the execution. We can either use the dBeaver interface or the watsonx.data CLI.

Presto Internal Access For local access the following credentials are used: Hostname: localhost Port: 8443 Username: ibmlhadmin Password: password Database: tpch In addition, you need to set the following driver properties: SSL True SSLTrustStorePath /certs/presto-key.jks SSLTrustStorePassword watsonx.data Presto External Access The watsonx.data Presto database requires that the certificate be extracted from the image and a host name be added to your workstation. The first step is to extract the Presto certificate onto your local file system. scp watsonx@192.168.252.2:/certs/presto-key.jks /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! Next add the following host information to your local hosts file. You may need to authenticate on your workstation in order to change the file. echo '192.168.252.2' watsonxdata | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts The database connection settings are: Hostname: watsonxdata Port: 8443 Username: ibmlhadmin Password: password Database: tpch In addition, you need to set the following driver properties: SSL True SSLTrustStorePath /mydownload/presto-key.jks SSLTrustStorePassword watsonx.data Note : The /mydownload/presto-key.jks value needs to be replaced with the location that you copied the key in the earlier step. Db2 Access When connecting to the Db2 engine, select the Db2 LUW driver. Db2 Internal Access The Db2 server can be accessed on port 50000 inside the virtual machine using the following credentials: Hostname - watsonxdata Port - 50000 Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off Db2 External Access When accessing the database outside the virtual machine, you must change the host to 192.168.252.2. All of the other settings remain the same. Hostname - 192.168.252.2 Port - 50000 Username - db2inst1 Password - db2inst1 Database - gosales SSL - off PostgreSQL Access When connecting to the PostgreSQL engine, select the PostgreSQL driver. In order to connect to the PostgreSQL system, you will need to extract the admin password using the following command when connected to the watsonx.data system. export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(docker exec ibm-lh-postgres printenv | grep POSTGRES_PASSWORD | sed 's/.*=//') echo \"Postgres Userid : admin\" echo \"Postgres Password : \" $POSTGRES_PASSWORD echo $POSTGRES_PASSWORD > /tmp/postgres.pw PostgreSQL Internal Access When accessing the PostgreSQL database in the system, use the following settings. Hostname \u2013 ibm-lh-postgres Port \u2013 5432 Username \u2013 admin Password \u2013 The value that was extracted in the earlier step Database \u2013 gosales PostgreSQL External Access The following credentials are used for remote access. Hostname: 192.168.252.2 Port: 5432 Username: admin Password: The value that was extracted in the earlier step Database name: gosales Adding a Database to watsonx.data When adding a database engine to the watsonx.data system, make sure to change the database display name since that needs to be unique. For instance, when you add GOSALES database from Db2 to the system, the display name could be GOSALES as well. However, if you now add the PostgreSQL database to the system, the display name cannot be the same. You may want to differentiate databases with the same name by prefixing them with the database type. For instance, the GOSALES database could be shown as db2_gosales or pg_gosales so that you keep the names distinct. Once a database has been added, make sure to wait for a few moments before attempting to access the database. The Presto server takes a few moments to start up. To make sure that it is running, run the check_presto command in a terminal window and wait until it says the service is ready. When attempting to view the contents of a new database, the process may take a few minutes to complete. Refresh the browser window if you haven't seen any changes to the display. Accessing watsonx.data via Python In order to access the watsonx.data database (Presto), you will need to install the Presto client using the following command on your local machine. pip3 install presto-python-client Once the installation is complete, extract the certificate from the watsonx.data server that we will use in the connection. scp watsonx@192.168.252.2:/certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember! Next add the following host information to your local hosts file. You may need to authenticate on your workstation in order to change the file. echo '192.168.252.2' watsonxdata | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts Your Python or Jupyter notebook code will need to import the prestodb library and then connect to watsonx.data using the connect call. import prestodb conn = prestodb.dbapi.connect( host='watsonxdata', port=8443, user='ibmlhadmin', catalog='tpch', schema='tiny', http_scheme='https', auth=prestodb.auth.BasicAuthentication(\"ibmlhadmin\", \"password\") ) conn._http_session.verify = '/Users/myname/Downloads/lh-ssl-ts.crt' cur = conn.cursor() In the above connection string, you will need to replace the following values: catalog - What is the name of the catalog that we are accessing schema - The schema inside the catalog that will be used You also need to update the conn._http_session.verify value with the location where you downloaded the lh-ssl-ts.crt file. Once connected, you can run an SQL statement and return the results. cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM tpch.tiny.customer\") rows = cur.fetchall() The rows variable contains the answer set from the select statement. You can manipulate the row variable to view the results. rows[0] [1, 'Customer#000000001', 'IVhzIApeRb ot,c,E', 15, '25-989-741-2988', 711.56, 'BUILDING', 'to the even, regular platelets. regular, ironic epitaphs nag e'] The PrestoDB driver supports the DBAPI spec. For more details on the use of the DBAPI interface, please refer to https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/ . For instance, if you want to find the description of the columns returned, you would use the description function. cur.description [('custkey', 'bigint', None, None, None, None, None), ('name', 'varchar(25)', None, None, None, None, None), ('address', 'varchar(40)', None, None, None, None, None), ('nationkey', 'bigint', None, None, None, None, None), ('phone', 'varchar(15)', None, None, None, None, None), ('acctbal', 'double', None, None, None, None, None), ('mktsegment', 'varchar(10)', None, None, None, None, None), ('comment', 'varchar(117)', None, None, None, None, None)] Accessing watsonx.data via Pandas Dataframes The following code is required for accessing watsonx.data in Jupyter notebooks. Run the following code inside a notebook code cell. %pip install ipython-sql==0.4.1 %pip install sqlalchemy==1.4.46 %pip install sqlalchemy==1.4.46 \"pyhive[presto]\" The notebook may need a restart of the kernel to pick up the changes to the driver. If you are running in a Jupyter Lab environment, you can use the most current versions of the drivers. %pip install ipython-sql %pip install sqlalchemy %pip install sqlalchemy \"pyhive[presto]\" Once the drivers have been loaded, you will need to extract the certificate from the watsonx.data server that we will use in the connection. scp watsonx@192.168.252.2:/certs/lh-ssl-ts.crt /Users/myname/Downloads Change the target directory to a location that you can remember!

Check out the following websites for a variety of public data sets that you can use. Awesome Public Datasets Kaggle Datasets US Data.Gov UCI Machine Learning Repository US Fuel Economy Note : These sites have not been checked for license restrictions on the use of the data. You are responsible for checking that the data can be used without any licensing requirements. Loading your own data You can use a browser or link to an external file repository (i.e., Box) and download data directly to your workstation. Once the data is on your workstation, use the following steps. Note : You cannot import customer data nor any data that has restrictions associated with its use. Any use of private data is in violation of the terms and conditions of using this image. The first step is to connect to MinIO. Extract the MinIO credentials by using the passwords command: passwords text Open your browser and navigate to: Minio console - http://192.168.252.2:9001 Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system). You should see the current buckets in MinIO. If you don't see the buckets, click on Object Browser on the left-hand side panel. Select hive-bucket from the list of buckets. You may see other directories in this list than what is shown above. You will need to create a new path for your data set. Create a new directory name for your data (fuel_economy was used for this example). MinIO will display an empty directory and suggest you load something into it. Use the Upload button on the far right side to point to your dataset on your local machine. In this example, we are using a CSV file for the 2013 fuel economy estimates for automobiles sold in the US. You may need to rename you datasets to eliminate blanks and any other special characters other than \" _ \" or \" - \". The display will show the progress of the upload into the bucket. You may need to refresh your browser to see the file in the bucket. Now that the data has been loaded into a bucket, you can catalog it in the watsonx.data UI. If you created a new bucket for this data set, you will need to register it first in the watsonx.data UI. Instructions for how to do this are found in the Working with Object Store Buckets section. Start by navigating to the watsonx.data UI and look at the Infrastructure manager. Find the bucket where you upload your data set into and note the catalog name that it is associated with. Here we can see that the hive-bucket bucket is associated with the hive_data catalog. In the watsonx.data UI, select the Query workspace (SQL) icon. You will need to create a schema that links to this data set. The format of the command is shown below. DROP SCHEMA catalog.schema_name; CREATE SCHEMA catalog.schema_name WITH ( location = 's3a://your-bucket/data_directory' ); You will need to change the following values: catalog - The catalog that the bucket you are using is associated with schema_name - A schema name to associate your tables with data_directory - The directory in which your file is located your_bucket - The bucket the data physically resides in For the fuel economy example, using mpg as the schema, the You neSQL would be: DROP SCHEMA hive_data.mpg; CREATE SCHEMA hive_data.mpg WITH ( location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Run this SQL against the Presto engine: The DROP command may fail if the schema doesn't exist, but the CREATE should work. The next step is to define what the table looks like for watsonx.data to be able to query it. The syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is similar to: CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.tablename ( \"column_name\" \"type\", ... ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://your_bucket/data_directory'); You will need to create a table definition for your CSV file in order to catalog it in watsonx.data. Note that the only data type that is permitted for CSV columns is varchar . This is a restriction of the current driver. Plans are to update it to include other data types over time. If your data set does not include a header row (a row that defines the column names), you will need to create the table definition manually. If the data set does contain a header record, you can use the following Python code to generate a CREATE TABLE statement.

Once the data is on your workstation, use the following steps. Note : You cannot import customer data nor any data that has restrictions associated with its use. Any use of private data is in violation of the terms and conditions of using this image. The first step is to connect to MinIO. Extract the MinIO credentials by using the passwords command: passwords text Open your browser and navigate to: Minio console - http://192.168.252.2:9001 Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system). You should see the current buckets in MinIO. If you don't see the buckets, click on Object Browser on the left-hand side panel. Select hive-bucket from the list of buckets. You may see other directories in this list than what is shown above. You will need to create a new path for your data set. Create a new directory name for your data (fuel_economy was used for this example). MinIO will display an empty directory and suggest you load something into it. Use the Upload button on the far right side to point to your dataset on your local machine. In this example, we are using a CSV file for the 2013 fuel economy estimates for automobiles sold in the US. You may need to rename you datasets to eliminate blanks and any other special characters other than \" _ \" or \" - \". The display will show the progress of the upload into the bucket. You may need to refresh your browser to see the file in the bucket. Now that the data has been loaded into a bucket, you can catalog it in the watsonx.data UI. If you created a new bucket for this data set, you will need to register it first in the watsonx.data UI. Instructions for how to do this are found in the Working with Object Store Buckets section. Start by navigating to the watsonx.data UI and look at the Infrastructure manager. Find the bucket where you upload your data set into and note the catalog name that it is associated with. Here we can see that the hive-bucket bucket is associated with the hive_data catalog. In the watsonx.data UI, select the Query workspace (SQL) icon. You will need to create a schema that links to this data set. The format of the command is shown below. DROP SCHEMA catalog.schema_name; CREATE SCHEMA catalog.schema_name WITH ( location = 's3a://your-bucket/data_directory' ); You will need to change the following values: catalog - The catalog that the bucket you are using is associated with schema_name - A schema name to associate your tables with data_directory - The directory in which your file is located your_bucket - The bucket the data physically resides in For the fuel economy example, using mpg as the schema, the You neSQL would be: DROP SCHEMA hive_data.mpg; CREATE SCHEMA hive_data.mpg WITH ( location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy' ); Run this SQL against the Presto engine: The DROP command may fail if the schema doesn't exist, but the CREATE should work. The next step is to define what the table looks like for watsonx.data to be able to query it. The syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is similar to: CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.tablename ( \"column_name\" \"type\", ... ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://your_bucket/data_directory'); You will need to create a table definition for your CSV file in order to catalog it in watsonx.data. Note that the only data type that is permitted for CSV columns is varchar . This is a restriction of the current driver. Plans are to update it to include other data types over time. If your data set does not include a header row (a row that defines the column names), you will need to create the table definition manually. If the data set does contain a header record, you can use the following Python code to generate a CREATE TABLE statement. You will need to make sure that pandas is available. python3 -m pip install pandas --user Next run the python3 command in the shell to run an interactive Python session. python3 Place the following code into your Python window. def showcsv(catalog, schema, tablename, bucket, directory, csv_in): import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(csv_in,na_values=\"-\") df = df.fillna(0) column_headers = list(df.columns.values) print(\"\") print(f\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename};\") print(f\"CREATE TABLE {catalog}.{schema}.{tablename}\") print(\" (\") comma = \"\" end = \"\" for header in column_headers: print(f\"{comma}\",end=end) comma = \",\" end = \"\\n\" print(f' \"{header}\" varchar',end=\"\") print(f\" )\") print(f\"WITH (\") print(f\" format = 'CSV',\") print(f\" csv_separator = ',',\") print(f\" external_location = 's3a://{bucket}/{directory}'\") print(f\" );\") print(\"\") def makesql(): catalog = input(\"Catalog : \") schema = input(\"Schema : \") table = input(\"Table : \") bucket = input(\"Bucket : \") dir = input(\"Directory : \") csv = input(\"CSV File : \") showcsv(catalog,schema,table,bucket,dir,csv) Gather the following information on your dataset: catalog - The catalog the schema and table are created under ( hive_data ) schema - The schema name that you created to hold your table ( mpg ) table name - The name of the table ( fuel_economy ) bucket - Where the data is located ( hive-bucket ) directory - What directory contains your data ( fuel_economy ) csv_in - The location on your local machine where the csv file is Once you have gathered that, run the following command in your Python window and answer the prompts. makesql() >>> makesql() Catalog : hive_data Schema : mpg Table : fueleconomy Bucket : hive-bucket Directory : fuel_economy CSV File : ~/Downloads/fuel_economy_2013.csv DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy; CREATE TABLE hive_data.mpg.fueleconomy ( \"MODEL_YEAR\" varchar, \"MFR_NAME\" varchar, \"DIVISION\" varchar, \"CARLINE\" varchar, \"ENG_DISPL\" varchar, \"CYL\" varchar, \"TRANS_IN_FE_GUIDE\" varchar, \"CITY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"HWY_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"COMB_FE_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"AIR_ASPIRATION_DESC\" varchar, \"TRANS_DESC\" varchar, \"GEARS\" varchar, \"DRIVE_DESC\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"FUEL_UNIT_DESC_CONVENTIONAL_FUEL\" varchar, \"ANNUAL_FUEL_COST_CONVENTIONAL\" varchar, \"FUEL_METERING_SYS_DESC\" varchar ) WITH ( format = 'CSV', csv_separator = ',', external_location = 's3a://hive-bucket/fuel_economy', ); Cut and paste the output from the command into the watsonx.data Data Explorer window to create the file.

Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. It is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple pie charts to highly detailed geospatial charts. Application Programming Interface (API)**: Application Programming Interface (API) is a programmatic interface for executing functions of an application in an automated or manual fashion without using a CLI or User Interface. Buckets : Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets. Catalog : This term may have many meanings depending on context. Review below: Service Catalog - A service catalog is a comprehensive list of cloud computing services that an organization offers its customers. The catalog is the only portion of the company's service portfolio that is published and provided to customers as a support to the sale or delivery of offered services. Data Catalog - A collection of business information describing the available datasets within an organization. Metastore Catalog - A collection of technical and operational metadata allowing a query engine to overlay a virtual table on a collection of discrete data files. Connector Catalog - The named representation of a connector within the virtual warehouse of a presto instance. Command Line Interface (CLI) : A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. dBeaver : DBeaver is a SQL client software application and a database administration tool. For relational databases it uses the JDBC application programming interface to interact with databases via a JDBC driver. For other databases it uses proprietary database drivers. Federation : A federated database is a system in which several databases appear to function as a single entity. Each component database in the system is completely self-sustained and functional. When an application queries the federated database, the system figures out which of its component databases contains the data being requested and passes the request to it. Federated databases can be thought of as database virtualization in much the same way that storage virtualization makes several drives appear as one. MinIO : MinIO is a high-performance, S3 compatible object store. It is built for large scale AI/ML, data lake and database workloads. It runs on-prem and on any cloud (public or private) and from the data center to the edge. MinIO is software-defined and open source under GNU AGPL v3. Object Storage : Object storage is a data storage architecture for storing unstructured data, which sections data into units\u2014objects\u2014and stores them in a structurally flat data environment. Each object includes the data, metadata, and a unique identifier that applications can use for easy access and retrieval. Presto : Presto is a distributed database query engine (written in Java) that uses the SQL query language. Its architecture allows users to query data sources such as Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka, AWS S3, Alluxio, MySQL, MongoDB and Teradata, and allows use of multiple data sources within a query. Presto is community-driven open-source software released under the Apache License. Presto's architecture is very similar to other database management systems using cluster computing, sometimes called massively parallel processing (MPP). SPARK : Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark can be used with watsonx.data but is not included in the wastonsx.data challenge environment image provided. TechZone (IBM Technology Zone) : IBM Technology Zone is the platform where participants in the watsonx.data challenge will be provided access via their team leader to a developer edition of watsonx.data with the challenge data sets pre-provisioned. Generally, it allows Go To Market teams and Business Partners to easily build technical 'Show Me' live environments, POTs, prototypes, and MVPs, which can then be customized and shared with peers and customers to experience IBM Technology. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) : VNC is a cross-platform screen-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol. VNC was created to control another computer remotely. You may know it best for its role in tech support services. Participants in the watsonx.data challenge will be using VNC after they have set up WireGuard VPN to access watsonx.data to run the software to complete the challenge. WireGuard : WireGuard is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted virtual private networks, and was designed with the goals of ease of use, high speed performance, and low attack surface. Participants in the watsonx.data challenge will be using WireGuard VPN with a config file shared by their team leader to access their developer edition of watsonx.data to complete the challenge.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"wxd-glossary/#glossary","text":"Apache Superset : Apache Superset is an open-source software application for data exploration and data visualization able to handle data at petabyte scale.

Rather than connect to an external S3 object store, we are going to use MinIO locally to run with watsonx.data. To connect to MinIO, you will need to extract the MinIO credentials by querying the docker container. You must be the root user to issue these commands. export LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') export LH_S3_SECRET_KEY=$(docker exec ibm-lh-presto printenv | grep LH_S3_SECRET_KEY | sed 's/.*=//') echo \"MinIO Userid : \" $LH_S3_ACCESS_KEY echo \"MinIO Password: \" $LH_S3_SECRET_KEY MinIO Userid : c4643026087cc21989eb5c12 MinIO Password: 93da45c5af87abd86c9dbc83 You can get all passwords for the system when you are logged in as the watsonx user by using the following command. passwords If you receive the following message: (zenity:29252): Gtk-WARNING **: 11:27:32.683: cannot open display: You will need to issue the command with the text option. passwords text Open your browser and navigate to: Minio console - http://192.168.252.2:9001 Login with object store credentials found above (These will be different for your system).

Creating Schemas and Tables Not all catalogs support creation of schemas - as an example, the TPCH catalog is not writeable. We will use the iceberg_data catalog for this exercise. We will need to get some details before we continue.

You should now see new objects under iceberg-bucket Click on the bucket name and you will see the customer table. Selecting the customer object will show that there is data and metadata in there.

It will be different on your system than the examples above. Copy the next code segment into Presto. CALL iceberg_data.system.rollback_to_snapshot('workshop','customer', You will see output similar to the following: CALL iceberg_data.system.rollback_to_snapshot('workshop','customer', -> At this point you will need to copy and paste your snapshot_id into the Presto command line and press return or enter.

Here is a list of common questions, problems, and potential solutions. What are the passwords for the serviers I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole A SQL Statement failed but there are no error messages Apache Superset isn't Starting Apache Superset screens differ from the lab My VPN doesn't work I am unable to use VPN Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked Presto doesn't appear to be working Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Queries are failing with a 400 code What are the passwords for the services? See the section on Passwords . You can get all passwords for the system when you are logged in as the watsonx user by using the following command. passwords If you are logged in as the root user, the syntax is slightly different: SSH_TTY=true SSH_CLIENT=true passwords I Can't Open up a Terminal Window with VNC or Guacamole First thing to remember is that you can't use VNC and the TechZone VM Remote Console (Guacamole) interface at the same time. Only one can be active at a time. If you can't use terminal windows in VNC If you find that the terminal icons \"spins\" inside the VNC window, this is caused by attempting to connect to the virtual machine by using the VM Remote Console button in your reservation details screen. To fix this problem, you must log out of the VNC session (top right corner of the Linux desktop - press the power button and choose logout). Once VNC logs back in you will be able use the terminal window. If you really want to use the Techzone VM Remote Console If you start with VNC, you need to fully shut it down if you want to switch to the TechZone Guacamole version. Commands to stop the VNC service are: ssh watsonx@192.168.252.2 sudo su - Once you have become root, issue the following commands: systemctl stop vncserver@:1 systemctl disable vncserver@:1 Now you can close the VNC window and use the Techzone Remote Console interface. A SQL Statement failed, but there are no error messages You need to use the Presto console http://192.168.252.2:8080 and search for the SQL statement. Click on the Query ID to find more details of the statement execution and scroll to the bottom of the web page to see any error details. Apache Superset isn't Starting If Superset doesn't start for some reason, you will need to reset it completely to try it again. First make sure you are connected as the watsonx user not root . Make sure you have stopped the terminal session that is running Apache Superset. Next remove the Apache Superset directory. sudo rm -rf /home/watsonx/superset We remove the docker images associated with Apache Superset. If no containers or volumes exist you will get an error message. docker ps -a -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker container rm --force docker volume list -q --filter \"name=superset\" | xargs docker volume rm --force Download the superset code again. git clone https://github.com/apache/superset.git The docker-compose-non-dev.yml file needs to be updated so that Apache Superset can access the same network that watsonx.data is using. cd ./superset cp docker-compose-non-dev.yml docker-compose-non-dev-backup.yml sed '/version: \"3.7\"/q' docker-compose-non-dev.yml > yamlfix.txt cat <<EOF >> yamlfix.txt networks: default: external: True name: ibm-lh-network EOF sed -e '1,/version: \"3.7\"/ d' docker-compose-non-dev.yml >> yamlfix.txt We update the Apache Superset code to version 2.1.0 . sed 's/\\${TAG:-latest-dev}/2.1.0/' yamlfix.txt > docker-compose-non-dev.yml Use docker-compose to start Apache Superset. docker compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up Apache Superset screens differ from the lab The Apache Superset project makes frequent changes to the types of charts that are available. In some cases they remove or merge charts. Since these charts changes are dynamic, we are not able to guarantee that our examples will look the same as what you might have on your system. My VPN doesn't work If you downloaded a VPN certificate, and it doesn't appear to work, locate the file on your file system and attempt to view it. If the contents of the file contains the word disabled , this indicates that you did not request the VPN certificate to be enabled. You will need to request another image in order to connect with VPN. The other option is to use the Virtual console (guacamole) provided with the reservation. This requires that all exercises in this lab be done in that machine environment. I am unable to use a VPN If you are blocked from using a VPN tunnel, you must use the guacamole interface provided in the reservation details (VM Remote Console). In this case, all URLs will need to be accessed using the Firefox browser that is in the image. Cut-and-paste only works inside the virtual machine so you must use the lab documentation inside the virtual machine. Once you click on the VM Remote Console button, the login screen for the image will be shown. Do not log into the watsonx userid yet! You will not be able to log on as watsonx due to the VNC service that is currently running in the machine. If you try to login you will lock up the screen! If this happens you should reboot the server. Once you have the login screen, select Techzone from the list of users. Enter IBMDem0s! as the password. Once you have gained access to the system, click on Activities at the top of the screen and search for Terminal. Once a terminal screen has opened, issue the following instructions. sudo su - No password should be required. systemctl stop vncserver@:1 systemctl disable vncserver@:1 exit Log out of the Techzone userid and log into the watsonx user. At this point you can run the lab using this environment. Note that all URLs will continue to work in this image with IP addresses of 192.168.252.2 . Presto doesn't appear to be working If you find that the watsonx.data UI is generating error messages that suggest that queries are not running, or that the Presto service is dead, you can force a restart of Presto with the following command: restart_presto This will stop the Presto server and restart it again. The command will also wait until the service is running before exiting. Displaying Db2 Schema is failing Occasionally when attempting to expand the Db2 catalog (schema), the watsonx.data UI will not display any data or issue an error message. You can try refreshing the browser (not the refresh icon inside the UI) and try again. If you find that this is failing again, open the Query workspace and run the following SQL (replace db2_gosales with the name you cataloged the database with). select count(*) from db2_gosales.gosalesdw.go_org_dim The result should be 123 and hopefully the tables that are part of the schema will display for you. Db2 is not allowing connections after a system restart If for reason you have stopped and restarted the server, the Db2 service may not refresh or allow for connections from the watsonx.data UI. This is caused by a setting in the Db2 container environment that attempts to rebuild the instance after a failure. The instance information is stored on a volume outside the container, so this step does not need to be performed. To enable Db2 to restart properly, run the following commands from the root user in the machine. sed -i 's/PERSISTENT_HOME=false/PERSISTENT_HOME=true/' /Docker/.env_list docker restart db2server Queries are failing with a 400 code The watsonx.data UI will log you out after a period of inactivity, but doesn't tell you that this has happened. When you attempt to run a query, the error that is returned (400) indicates that you need to log back in again. Too many incorrect logins using VNC and now I'm blocked from connecting If you lock yourself out of VNC because of too many incorrect logins, you can reset the service with the following commands. Connect as the root user. ssh watsonx@192.168.252.2 sudo su - Then run the following command and you should be able to log in again. systemctl restart vncserver@:1 exit","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"wxd-troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-watsonxdata","text":"Although we have tried to make the lab as error-free as possible, occasionally things will go wrong.
