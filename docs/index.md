# Introducing IBM watsonx.data 

![WatsonX](wxd-images/watsonxlogoibm.png)


The next-gen IBM watsonx.data lakehouse is designed to overcome the costs and complexities enterprises face. This will be the world’s first and only open data store with multi-engine support that is built for hybrid deployment  across your entire ecosystem.
 
   * WatsonX.data is the only lakehouse with multiple query engines allowing you to optimize costs and performance by pairing the right workload with the right engine.
   * Run all workloads from a single pane of glass, eliminating trade-offs with convenience while still improving cost and performance.
   * Deploy anywhere with full support for hybrid-cloud and multi cloud environments.
   * Shared metadata across multiple engines eliminates the need to re-catalog, accelerating time to value while ensuring governance and eliminating costly implementation efforts.

This lab uses the IBM watsonx.data developer package. The Developer package is meant to be used on single nodes. While it uses the same code base, there are some restrictions, especially on scale. In this lab, we will open some additional ports as well to understand how everything works. We will also use additional utilities to illustrate connectivity and what makes the IBM watsonx.data “open”. 
We organized this book into 8 labs that cover many of the highlights and key features of IBM watsonx.data.

   * Lab 1: Access a Techzone image for testing
   * Lab 2: Starting IBM watsonx.data
   * Lab 3: Introduction to IBM watsonx.data components
   * Lab 4: Analytical SQL
   * Lab 5: Advanced SQL functions
   * Lab 6: Time Travel and Federation
   * Lab 7: Working with Object Store Buckets
   * Lab 8: Using the IBM Tool Loader

In addition, there is an Appendix which includes common errors and potential fixes or workarounds. 

To get started, reserve a Techzone image, or download the VMware image.
